{"name":"Binya","tagline":"The Ruby wrapper for the Fed","body":"# Binya\r\n\r\nBinya is a Ruby library for parsing information from Federal Reserve sites. Its initial utility is to parse [a listing of speeches, testimony and other comments](http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/date.aspx) by Federal Open Market Committee participants and return Ruby objects. It also provides details about the FOMC participants via a YAML file that can be loaded.\r\n\r\nBinya is named for [Binyamin Applebaum](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/binyamin_appelbaum/index.html), a Washington correspondent for The New York Times.\r\n\r\nBinya is tested under Ruby 1.9.3.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'binya'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install binya\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nBinya pulls information from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which has a site that tracks [members of the Federal Open Market Committee](http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/index.aspx) and [public remarks they make](http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/date.aspx). The FOMC participants are stored in a YAML file within the gem and can be loaded like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'rubygems'\r\nrequire 'binya'\r\n\r\nparticipants = Binya::Participant.load_all\r\nputs participants.first\r\n=> #<Binya::Participant:0x007f987b924e90 @fomc_id=2, @name=\"Ben S. Bernanke\", @title=\"Chairman, Board of Governors\", @term_start=#<Date: 2006-02-01 ((2453768j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, @term_end=nil, @rss_url=\"http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/xml/fomcspeak-bernanke-2-feed.xml\", @img_url=\"http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/Participants/bernanke_ben.jpg\", @fomc_name=\"Chairman Bernanke\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `fomc_id` corresponds to the number used in FOMC URLs like [this one for Ben S. Bernanke](http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/Participant.aspx?id=2). The `fomc_name` is how each participant appears in the [HTML listings of remarks](http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/date.aspx).\r\n\r\nIndividual participants in the FOMC have their own RSS feeds that contain similar information to the HTML remark lists, but the RSS feeds puts the \"type\", \"where\" and \"what\" columns from the HTML lists into a single attribute. Still, Binya has methods that you can use to load all FOMC participant RSS feeds or individual participant feeds if those fit your needs better:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# pulls from rss feeds of FOMC participants - this puts type, location and title into a single field\r\nlatest_from_rss = Binya::Remarks.latest\r\n# grabs a single participant and pulls his/her RSS feed\r\nparticipants = Binya::Participants.load_all\r\nben = participants.detect{|p| p.fomc_name == 'Chairman Bernanke'}\r\nben.latest_remarks\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the St. Louis Fed site uses Javascript postbacks for pagination, Binya includes local HTML versions of the remarks listings that can be loaded to have remarks objects back to August 2010. Binya also is capable of scraping the latest \"front page\" of remarks listings, which is ordered by date descending:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# scrapes locally-stored HTML files\r\nresults = Binya::Remarks.fetch_previous\r\nputs results.size\r\n=> 275\r\n\r\n# scrapes http://www.stlouisfed.org/fomcspeak/date.aspx\r\nresults = Binya::Remarks.fetch_html\r\nputs results.first\r\n#<Binya::Remarks:0x007f987b8f2dc8 @date=#<Date: 2013-07-02 ((2456476j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, @time=2013-07-02 17:45:00 -0400, @participant=\"Jerome H. Powell\", @participant_id=22, @type=\"Speech\", @location=\"The University Club, New York, N.Y.\", @title=\"International Financial Regulatory ReformÂ \", @url=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20130702a.htm\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
